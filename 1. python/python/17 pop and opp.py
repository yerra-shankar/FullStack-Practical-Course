'''
    pop
(procedural oriented programming)

--> programs are divided into functions 
--> top to down approach
--> no access specifiers
--> no data security
--> no overloading concepts


example:-( c lang, vb script, fortran, pascal) its called a pop languages


ex:-
    
                            (main)
                  /            |            \ 

(function 1              function 2              function 3)    
( local data               local data             local data)    
              \                |                 /
                \              |               /
                  \ ------(global data) ---- /



global data access every functons.

     opp
(object oriented programming)

--> programs are divided into objects
--> bottom to up approach
--> provide access specifiers
--> data security
--> function overloading
    opertor overloading
    method overiding


example:-(c++,java ,python)its called a opps language


object means (data and functions)are changing the single unit its called a object.
every object has a connections

ex:-

    object                        object

(data/functions) ------------- (data/functions)
              \              /
               \            /
               (data/fuctions)



(reuse code)
 using inheritance topic for reuse the code.because of provideing high data.
 there are different types inheritance
