Javascript offers three types of popup boxes, they are:
   1. Alert
   2. Prompt
   3. Confirm

1. alert box : An alert box is used when you want to ensure that information gets through to the user.
when an alert box pops up, the user must click ok to proceed.
The alert function takes a single parameter, which is the text displayed in the popup box.

syntax:-
         alert("message to show / parameter");

Be careful when using alert boxes, as the user can continue using the page only after clicking Ok.

open (14.alert.html) for the example





2. prompt box:- A prompt box is often used to have the user input a value before entering a page.
When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either OK or Cancel to proceed after entering the 
input value.
if the user clicks Ok, the box returns the input value. if the user clicks Cnacel, the box returns null

The prompt() method takes two parameters.
--The first is the label, which you want to display in the text box.
--The second is a default string to display in the text box (optional).

   syntax:-
            prompt("message to show");

---> When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after 
     entering an input value.
---> Do not overuse this method, because it prevents the user from accessing other parts of the page
     until the box is closed




3. confirm box :  A confirm box is often used to have the user verify or accept something.
      when a confirm box pops up, the user must click either Ok or Cancel to proceed.
      if the user clicks Ok, the box returns true. if the user clicks Cancel, the box returns false.

      syntax:-
               confirm("message to show")

Do not overuse this method, because it also prevents the user from accessing other parts of the pagesuntil the box is closed.
