  BOM:-

        The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows javaScript to "talk to" the browser.

        The Browser Object Model (BOM) 
        There are no offical standards for the Browser Object Model (BOM).

        Since modern browsers have implemented (almost) the same methods and properties for javascript
        interactivity, it is often referred to, as method and properties of the BOM.

    

    The window Object
            
        The window object is supported by all browsers. it represents the browser's window.

        All global javascript object, functions, and variables automatically become members of the 
        window object.

        Global variables are properties of the window object.
        Global functions are methods of the window object.

        Even the document object (of the HTML DOM) is a property of the window object :
                 
               window.document.getElementByid("header");
               is the same as:
               document.getElementByid("header")



    Window Size
        
        The properties can be used to determine the size of the browser window.
         
        Both properties return the sizes in pixels:


            window.innerHeight----the inner height of the browser window (in pixels)
            window.innerWidth-----the inner width of the browser window (in pixels)

        The browser window (the browser viewport) is NOT including toolbar and scrolbars.


      properties

        window.screen   ---- the window.screen object conatins information about the user's screen.
        window.location ---- the window.location object can be used to get the current page address (URL)
                               and to redirect the browser to anew page.
        window.history ---- the window.history object contains the browser history
        history.back() ---- same as clicking back in the browser
        history.forward() ---- same as clicking forward in the browser



    javscript Cookies :
          Cookies let you store user information in web pages.
          Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.

          when a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the 
          server forgets everything about the user.

          Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the
           user":
           
              when a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.
              Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.+

                
 document.cookie -----javascript can create, read, and delete cookies with the document.cookie property
