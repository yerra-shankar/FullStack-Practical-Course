 ---Components lifeCycle methods ---
 Each component has several "lifecycle methods" that you can override to run code at particular times
 in the process.

  --> lifecycle methods are four types
     1. Mounting
     2. updating
     3. Unmounting
     4. Error Handling

 1. Mounting:
 These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM 
   --> Methods
   * constructor
   * Static getDerivedStateFromProps()
   * render()
   * componentDidMount()

2. Updating:
An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:
 -->Methods
 * Static getDerivedStateFromProps()
 * shouldComponentUpdate()
 * render()
 * getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
 * componentDidUpdate()

 3. Unmounting
 This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:
 ---> Method:
  * componentWillUnmoun t()


  4. Error Handling
  These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the 
  constructor of any child component.
 ---> Methods:
 * Static getDerivedStateFromError()
 * componentDidCatch()
